"It's impossible to do surveillance on everybody."Since <DATE>2012</DATE>, he said, al Qaeda had been "trying to talent spot" Western jihadists on the battlefields of <LOCATION>Syria</LOCATION> for use in potential operations against the West, while <ORGANIZATION>ISIS</ORGANIZATION> had appeared more focused on state building. But since the start of the U.S.-led air campaign targeting <ORGANIZATION>ISIS</ORGANIZATION>, the concern had grown that <ORGANIZATION>ISIS</ORGANIZATION> would also focus on directly targeting Western countries."And the worry is that competition between al Qaeda and the <ORGANIZATION>Islamic State</ORGANIZATION> will see both groups try to outdo each other with attacks in the West," he said.Names of victims begin to emergeCNN's <PERSON>Paul Cruickshank</PERSON>, <PERSON>Ivan Watson</PERSON>, <LOCATION>Nima Elbagir</LOCATION>, <PERSON>Sebastian Knoops</PERSON>, <PERSON>Margot Haddad</PERSON>, <PERSON>Brian Walker</PERSON>, <PERSON>Stephanie Halasz</PERSON>, <PERSON>Vasco Cotovio</PERSON> and <PERSON>Antonia Mortensen</PERSON> contributed to this report.
