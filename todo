    * Using zip_codes_states.csv is just to demonstrate the concept. The data should be integrated into database instead of using a file.
    * Currently item_id and document_id are used (kind of) interchangeablely but we should only use document_id's, which should be copied/updated/added from existing item_id's.
        ** In transcription: item_id is mainly used
        ** In tagging: document_id is mainly used
    * Currently transcribe is a demo for the concept (list view, map view, and timeline view). Tag and connect might have a lot in common, especially tag.
    * Tags are currently added to database w/o checking if there are duplicates
    * Currently task lists (documents/(transcribe, tag)) only show documents that are never tried before, that is, currently transcribing and tagging can only be done once and they won't be shown to the task lists. So the functions names are getDocumentsWithout(Transcription/Tag) but instead, they should be getDocumentsNeed(Transcribing/Taggin) and we need to define mechanisms to determine them.
    * The three views (map, list, timeline) in task lists (documents/(transcribe, tag)) work now but they are not connected yet.

    * Search part for Discover (currently there is no "search" implemented yet)
    * Integrate existing entity information and NER (currently we only use NER)

11/20/2015:
    * Issues with the tagging task:
        ** Sometimes it's hard to find an appropriate entity for an event (See item 1 for example)

	* Fix Image viewer: not working correctly for zooming and dragging the image

11/11/2015:

Webpage:
	* Need to update login/signup status after trying
		** Success: update topright status
		** Failure: show error message on login/signup dialog
	* Need to complete the search part of Discover

10/28/2015:

Database:
	* Test all functions, especially tag, connect and discuss
	* Refactoring (lower priority)

Webpage templates:
	* Discussion: 
		** Add a page for creating a new discussion
		** Add discussion part to pages of documents
	* Modify the design/layout based on actual data and previous discussion/comments
	* Webpages for administration such as marking some transcriptions as approved
	* Unify all browsing pages to "discover" page before user history is considered
	* Add homepage (introduction, tutorial and transition to discover page)

Computation:
	* Named Entity Recognition

Design:
	* Categories for entities
		** Distinguish primary and secondary categories as well as additional ones

Other:
	* General
		** Update actions other than show and transcribe
		** Update the case when there is no resources with given ID for show and transcribe
		** Use slug instead of numeric ID
		** If the user is not logged in, there will be error and should try to handle it.
	* Discuss 
		** pages are still generic and need actual data (also the show and add actions are still empty)
