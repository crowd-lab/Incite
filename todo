Database:
	* Test all functions, especially tag, connect and discuss
	* Refactoring (lower priority)

Webpage templates:

	* Discussion: 
		** Add a page for creating a new discussion
		** Add discussion part to pages of documents
	* Modify the design/layout based on actual data and previous discussion

Other:

	* Update actions other than show and transcribe
	* Discuss pages are still generic and need actual data (also the show and add actions are still empty)
	* Update the case when there is no resources with given ID for show and transcribe
	* Use slug instead of numeric ID
	* If the user is not logged in, there will be error and should try to handle it.
